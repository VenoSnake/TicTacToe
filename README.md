**Specialization** : Gaming, Reinforced Machine Learning(soon)

**Description** : Artificial Neural Networks Have Been A Breakthrough In Many Sectors, And Gaming Is One Of Them. This Present Repository Aims At Delivering A Never Lose AI Model (Worst Case Outcome Being A Draw). The Whole TicTacToe Game With A GUI Has Been Coded In Python From Scratch.

**Note : Currently Only The TicTacToe Game Has Been Coded, Although This Projects Aim To Deliver An AI Bot Soon, Due To Limited Time Availability And Due To The Transition From Working Under A Keras Framework To PyTorch It Would Be Taking A Bit Longer Than Expected**
